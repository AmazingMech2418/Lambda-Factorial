# Lambda Factorial

Lambda calculus, invented by Alonzo Church (Alan Turing's teacher!), is the bridge between pure mathematics and computer programming.

Lambda calculus is the backbone for functional programming languages.

In my pursuit of learning lambda calculus, I created an anonymous recursive factorial function in JavaScript, using Church encoding for all numbers and booleans involved. I then started a Python version and am now working on expanding this, starting with Haskell (now complete!), and decided to make this another "x in many languages" project. 

## Repo Overview

In this repo, there are folders for each language, and a WIP folder with languages I'm working on adding, but might have a few bugs.

Inside each language folder, there is a main/index file and a full file. The main/index file contains a full written out and easier to follow version of the lambda calculus implementation, and the full version contains a single anonymous function, and a wrapper for automatic converting between integers and Church numerals.
